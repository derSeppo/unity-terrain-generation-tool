# Unity Terrain-Generation Tool

A Unity-Engine package I wrote as part of my bachelor's thesis.

It is able to create terrain-objects and heightmaps based on fractal perlin noise and hydraulic erosion.\
Additionally a drawn base-heightmap can be inserted to restrict the height of the generated terrain.

## How to install
1. Open the Unity Package-Manager inside the Unity-Editor
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top left of the window
3. Select "add from disk"
4. Search for the "package.json" file

Done!

## How to use
1. Start the generator through "Tool/Terrain Generator" in the editor-toolbar
2. Adjust the parameters
3. Click "Generate" to create a new terrain
   - Click "Export as PNG" to save the generated heightmap image
